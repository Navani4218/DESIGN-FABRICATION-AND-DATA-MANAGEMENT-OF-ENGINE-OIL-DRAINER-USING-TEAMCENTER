# DESIGN-FABRICATION-AND-DATA-MANAGEMENT-OF-ENGINE-OIL-DRAINER-USING-TEAMCENTER

Bike mechanics drain the used engine oil by the manual method of removing the drain nut and
storing the oil by placing plastic trays under the engine. This increases the time required to drain
the oil completely from the engine block to the plastic tray and reduces bike mechanics'
productivity.

The Engine Oil Draining machine fabricated in this project solves the problem. In this prototype,
we have used both suction and vacuum pumps for better draining of used Engine Oil from the
Engine block. This machine is fabricated to reduce the risks of manpower and the time required for
manual removal. Engine oil has been used in various applications that can be reused for various
purposes.

In this process of fabricating this machine from ideation to prototype, we have used a software
named Siemens Teamcenter which is integrated with Siemens NX-CAD for storing CAD data files.
It is one of the PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) software that allows to perform tasks such
as workflow manager, BMIDE, My Teamcenter, Structure Manager, Schedule Manager, and many
more to increase the productivity of tasks involved.
